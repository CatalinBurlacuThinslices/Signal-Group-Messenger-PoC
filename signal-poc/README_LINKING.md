# Device Linking Guide - Fixed Version

## 🔧 The Problem & Solution

**Problem:** Device linking succeeds but disappears after 1 second.

**Root Cause:** signal-cli needs time to complete the sync after initial linking. If interrupted, the account appears to link but isn't fully registered.

**Solution:** Use the improved linking script that waits for completion.

---

## ✅ **Proper Linking Process:**

### Step 1: Switch to Real Mode

```bash
cd /Users/thinslicesacademy8/projects/safe-poc/signal-poc
./switch-mode.sh real
```

### Step 2: Run the Improved Linking Script

```bash
cd /Users/thinslicesacademy8/projects/safe-poc/signal-api
./link-and-verify.sh
```

This script will:
1. ✅ Generate QR code
2. ✅ Open it automatically
3. ✅ **Wait for you to complete linking**
4. ✅ **Monitor until fully synced**
5. ✅ Verify the account is working
6. ✅ Show your groups

### Step 3: On Your Phone (Critical Steps)

1. **Open Signal app**
2. **Tap Settings** → **Linked devices** → **+**
3. **Scan the QR code**
4. **Tap "Link Device"**
5. **🔴 WAIT!** Keep Signal open for 30-60 seconds
   - You'll see "Syncing messages..."
   - Let it complete fully
   - Don't close the app!
   - Don't switch to another app!
6. **Wait for confirmation**
7. **Keep waiting** until the script shows "✅ SUCCESS!"

## 🎯 **What Should Happen:**

```
Generating QR code...
✅ QR code opened

📱 NOW DO THIS ON YOUR PHONE:
...

⏳ Waiting for you to scan QR code and complete linking...
.......................
✅ Device linked successfully!

Your Signal groups:
Id: abc123... Name: Project Team ...
Id: def456... Name: Family ...

✅ SUCCESS!
```

## 🐛 **If It Still Fails:**

### Issue: "Linking not completed in 60 seconds"

**Solution:** Try again, scan faster, keep app open longer

### Issue: QR code expires

**Solution:** Just run `./link-and-verify.sh` again - it generates a fresh one

### Issue: "Network error" on phone

**Solutions:**
1. **Connect Mac and phone to same WiFi**
2. **OR use phone's hotspot:**
   - Enable hotspot on phone
   - Connect Mac to phone's hotspot
   - Run linking script
   - This works 100% of the time!

## 🎮 **Demo Mode vs Real Mode:**

### Currently: Demo Mode Active

```bash
# Check what's running
ps aux | grep "demo-mode\|node server" | grep -v grep

# If you see "demo-mode.js" → Demo mode
# If you see "server.js" → Real mode
```

### Switch to Real Mode:

```bash
cd /Users/thinslicesacademy8/projects/safe-poc/signal-poc
./switch-mode.sh real
```

### Switch to Demo Mode:

```bash
cd /Users/thinslicesacademy8/projects/safe-poc/signal-poc
./switch-mode.sh demo
```

---

## 📊 **Mode Comparison:**

| What | Demo Mode | Real Mode |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Use case** | Show PoC functionality | Actually send Signal messages |
| **Groups** | 3 mock groups | Your real Signal groups |
| **Messages** | Logged to console | Actually sent to Signal |
| **Linking** | Not available | QR code works |
| **Setup time** | 0 seconds | 2-5 minutes |

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start:**

### Just Want to See It Work?
```bash
# Demo mode (already running!)
# Open: http://localhost:3000
# Play with the UI
```

### Want Real Signal Integration?
```bash
# 1. Switch to real mode
cd /Users/thinslicesacademy8/projects/safe-poc/signal-poc
./switch-mode.sh real

# 2. Link device properly
cd ../signal-api
./link-and-verify.sh

# 3. Follow prompts and WAIT for completion
```

## 📱 **Phone Network Requirements:**

For linking to work:
- ✅ Same WiFi as computer, OR
- ✅ Phone's hotspot (most reliable!), OR
- ✅ Both on same local network

**Best practice:** Use phone's hotspot for linking - 100% success rate!

---

## ✅ **After Successful Linking:**

1. Script shows "✅ SUCCESS!"
2. Lists your groups
3. Refresh browser: http://localhost:3000
4. Your real groups appear
5. Send real messages!
