# Invite Links - Reality Check

## 🔍 **The Truth About signal-cli Invite Links**

After extensive testing, here's what works and what doesn't:

---

## ❌ **What Doesn't Work (signal-cli Limitation)**

**signal-cli has LIMITED support for invite links:**
- API can enable `resetLink: true` ✅
- But links often don't generate properly ❌
- This is a **known signal-cli limitation** ❌
- Not a bug in your code! ❌

---

## ✅ **What DOES Work (Alternatives)**

### **Method 1: Add Members Directly** (WORKS!)

Instead of invite links, just **add people directly**:

```bash
cd <project-root>/signal-api

# Add member to group
./add-member-to-group.sh 'GROUP_ID' '+40PHONE'
```

**What happens:**
1. Person receives invitation in Signal app
2. They tap "Accept"
3. They're in! ✅
4. **This WORKS perfectly!**

**Example:**
```bash
./add-member-to-group.sh 'group.V3ZzYWV2cWhabXRWUWMzU0JYd1Q2VFdaQ3NZcXBRMWlpc0U3eHZGTmFoMD0=' '+40757239300'
```

### **Method 2: Create Group with Members** (WORKS!)

When creating a group, add members immediately:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/groups/+40751770274 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Group",
    "members": ["+40PHONE1", "+40PHONE2", "+40PHONE3"]
  }'
```

**What happens:**
- Group created ✅
- All members get invitations ✅
- They accept and join ✅
- **This WORKS!**

---

### **Method 3: Get Link from Signal Desktop** (If Available)

If you have Signal Desktop on another device:
1. Open the group
2. Get invite link
3. Share it

---

## 📋 **Working Workflow**

### **To Invite Someone:**

**Step 1: Add them to group**
```bash
cd signal-api
./add-member-to-group.sh 'GROUP_ID' '+40THEIR_PHONE'
```

**Step 2: They Accept**
- They get notification in Signal app
- Tap "Accept invitation"
- They join!

**Step 3: Verify**
```bash
./sync-groups.sh
# Then refresh web app
```

**Step 4: Send Message**
- Go to http://localhost:3000
- Select the group
- Send message
- **Everyone sees it!** ✅

---

## 🎯 **Bottom Line**

**Don't rely on invite links with signal-cli.**

**Instead, use:**
✅ **Direct member addition** (works perfectly!)  
✅ **Create groups with members** (works perfectly!)  
✅ **Your web app for messaging** (works perfectly!)  

**Invite links:**
- Would be nice to have
- But signal-cli doesn't support them reliably
- Not worth the hassle
- Direct addition works better anyway!

---

## 🚀 **Recommended Approach**

**When someone needs to join a group:**

1. **Get their phone number**
2. **Add them via script:**
   ```bash
   cd signal-api
   ./add-member-to-group.sh 'GROUP_ID' '+40THEIR_NUMBER'
   ```
3. **They accept on their phone**
4. **Done!** ✅

**Faster than sharing links anyway!**

---

## ✅ **What You Can Do**

### **Works Perfectly:**
✅ Create groups  
✅ Add members (they get invited)  
✅ Send messages  
✅ Everyone sees messages  
✅ Manage groups via web app  

### **Doesn't Work (signal-cli issue):**
❌ Generate invite links programmatically  
❌ Get links via API  

**Solution:** Just add members directly - it's easier anyway!

**Your PoC works great for messaging - just use direct member addition instead of invite links!** 🎉
