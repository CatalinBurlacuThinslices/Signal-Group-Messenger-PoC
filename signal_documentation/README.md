# Signal Notification Solutions Documentation

This documentation covers various approaches to implementing Signal messaging in your application.

## Overview

Signal is a secure messaging platform that can be integrated into applications through several methods. This documentation explores three main approaches:

1. **signal-cli-rest-api** - A REST API wrapper around signal-cli
2. **signal-cli** - Direct command-line interface for Signal
3. **libsignal** - The underlying Signal Protocol library
