   - Azure deployment guide: https://stefanstranger.github.io/2021/06/01/RunningSignalRESTAPIinAppService/
   - Multiple implementation examples

### ❌ Cons

1. **Dependency Chain**
   - Depends on signal-cli underneath
   - May be affected by signal-cli breaking changes
   - Additional layer of abstraction

2. **Deployment Requirements**
   - Requires Docker or standalone deployment
   - Needs persistent storage for signal data
   - Requires port management

3. **Resource Usage**
   - More resource-intensive than direct CLI
   - Runs as a separate service
   - Network overhead for API calls

4. **Potential Issues** (from community articles)
   - Rate limiting considerations
   - Number registration can be complex
   - Phone number verification required
   - Captcha challenges possible during registration

### Best For
- Production applications
- Microservices architecture
- Multiple language environments
- Teams familiar with REST APIs
- Scenarios requiring scalability

## Solution 2: signal-cli

**Repository:** https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli

### Description
A command-line interface for Signal that allows direct interaction with Signal's services through terminal commands.

### ✅ Pros

1. **Direct Signal Integration**
   - Can use real Signal accounts
   - No additional abstraction layer
   - Full Signal protocol support

2. **Lightweight**
   - No web server required
   - Lower resource usage
   - Simpler deployment

3. **Complete Control**
   - Direct access to all Signal features
   - Fine-grained command options
   - Scriptable operations

### ❌ Cons

1. **Integration Complexity**
   - Backend needs to execute CLI commands
   - Requires wrapper/adapter code
   - Process management overhead

2. **Error Handling**
   - Parsing command output required
   - Less structured error responses
   - Shell execution risks

3. **Maintenance Risks**
   - May break when Signal changes protocols
   - Command interface might change
   - Less stable than API approach

4. **Development Experience**
   - More boilerplate code needed
   - Harder to debug
   - Less intuitive for web developers

### Best For
- Quick scripts and automation
- Single-server deployments
- System administrators
- Shell scripting environments

## Solution 3: libsignal (Signal Protocol Library)

**Repository:** https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal

### Description
The underlying cryptographic protocol library that powers Signal. Allows building custom messaging systems using Signal's encryption.

### ✅ Pros

1. **Maximum Flexibility**
   - Complete control over implementation
   - Custom messaging systems possible
   - Can integrate into existing infrastructure

2. **No External Dependencies**
   - Direct protocol implementation
   - No signal-cli dependency
   - Self-contained solution

3. **Custom Features**
   - Build custom workflows
   - Integrate with proprietary systems
   - Customize encryption parameters

### ❌ Cons

1. **Heavy Setup**
   - Complex implementation required
   - Deep cryptography knowledge needed
   - Significant development time

2. **No Real Signal Users**
   - Cannot message real Signal accounts
   - Separate messaging network
   - Limited to your own infrastructure

3. **Maintenance Burden**
   - Must maintain protocol compatibility
   - Security updates required
   - Protocol changes must be tracked

4. **Missing Features**
   - No built-in server infrastructure
   - Manual key management
   - Custom client development needed

### Best For
- Building proprietary messaging systems
- Academic/research projects
- High-security custom implementations
- Organizations with cryptography expertise
