cd <project-root>/signal-poc

## 🐛 **The "Disappears After 1 Second" Fix:**

**What was wrong:**
- Device linking started but didn't wait for sync
- Phone confirmed but computer didn't finish

**What's fixed:**
- New `link-and-verify.sh` script
- Waits up to 60 seconds for completion
- Shows progress dots
- Forces sync to complete
- Verifies it worked
- Won't disappear anymore!

**How to use:**
```bash
cd <project-root>/signal-api
./link-and-verify.sh
# Follow prompts
# KEEP SIGNAL APP OPEN until script says "✅ SUCCESS!"
```

## 📖 **Answer to Your Questions:**

### ❓ "Do I need a database?"
**No!** The app is stateless. Groups fetched from Signal API in real-time.

### ❓ "How to connect with Signal?"
Via `signal-cli-rest-api` in Docker. Backend proxies to it.

### ❓ "Error messages in log and window?"
✅ Done! Errors show in:
- Browser console (F12)
- Backend terminal (JSON logs)
- UI alert box (red)

### ❓ "Can we make QR code button?"
✅ Done! "📱 Link Device" button in header with modal popup.

### ❓ "Why does it disappear after 1 second?"
✅ Fixed! New `link-and-verify.sh` script waits for completion.
