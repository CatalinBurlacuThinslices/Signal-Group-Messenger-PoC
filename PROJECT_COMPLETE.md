cd <project-root>
./START_PROJECT.sh
```

**Open:** http://localhost:3000

---

## ✨ **What Works**

✅ Real-time error messages  
✅ Status indicators  
✅ Sync on refresh  
✅ Beautiful modern UI with tab toggle  

### **Technical Features:**

✅ Express backend with broadcast API  
✅ Signal API integration (Docker)  
✅ Error handling (UI + console + logs)  
✅ Demo & real modes  
✅ Link Device with QR code modal  
✅ Command line scripts for automation  
✅ One-command startup  

---

## 🎯 **The Reality for Your PoC**

### **What signal-cli (and wrappers) CAN do:**
✅ Send messages to groups ← **Working!**  
✅ Create groups ← **Working!**  
✅ Add members (they get invited) ← **Working!**  
✅ When they accept on THEIR phone, it works ← **Working!**  

### **What signal-cli struggles with:**
❌ Accepting invitations FROM the project  
❌ Some GroupsV2 advanced features  
❌ Certain group operations  

---

## 🛠️ **Working API Operations**

### **1. Create Group with Members**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/groups/+40751770274 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Group Name",
    "members": ["+40PHONE1", "+40PHONE2"]
  }'
```
✅ All members get invited  
✅ Works perfectly  

### **2. Send Messages to Groups**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v2/send \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "message": "Hello!",
    "number": "+40XXXXXXXXX",
    "recipients": ["GROUP_ID"]
  }'
```
✅ Everyone sees messages  
✅ Works great

### **3. Send to Phone Number (NEW!)** 📞
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/send-to-phone \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "phoneNumber": "+40751770274",
    "message": "Hello!"
  }'
```
✅ Direct messaging to individuals  
✅ No group needed  

### **4. Broadcast to Multiple People (NEW!)** 📤
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/broadcast \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "phoneNumbers": ["+40751770274", "+12025551234", "+447700900123"],
    "message": "Hello everyone!"
  }'
```
✅ Send same message to multiple recipients  
✅ Perfect for notifications  

### **Command Line Scripts:**
```bash
cd signal-poc

# Send to one person
./send-to-phone.sh "+40751770274" "Hello!"

# Broadcast to multiple people
./broadcast.sh "+40751770274,+12025551234" "Hello team!"
```
✅ Easy automation  
✅ Shell and Node.js versions  

### **❌ DOESN'T WORK:**
- ❌ cannot accept invite links (we can only create groups to be in it)
- ❌ cannot invite people in already existing groups, only the admin memebers of the group can invite
**Invite Links via API**
- ❌ signal-cli limitation  
- ❌ Links stay empty  
- ❌ `resetLink: true` doesn't generate them

## 🎯 **What We Discovered & Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Device Linking**
- **Problem:** Messages appeared as "notes to self"
- **Cause:** signal-cli linked devices have limitations
- **Solution:** Use primary registration instead ✅

### **Issue 2: Group Messages Not Visible**
- **Problem:** Only sender could see messages
- **Cause:** Linked device mode limitations
- **Solution:** Primary registration - **NOW WORKING!** ✅

### **Issue 3: Group ID Format**
- **Problem:** Wrong group ID format caused errors
- **Cause:** Using internal_id vs full group.XXX id
- **Solution:** Use full group ID with "group." prefix ✅

### **Issue 4: Groups Not Syncing**
- **Problem:** New groups didn't appear
- **Cause:** No auto-sync
- **Solution:** Added sync to refresh button ✅

## ⚙️ **Prerequisites & Initial Setup**

### **Before First Use - Register Your Number**

**Important:** You MUST register your phone number as a **primary account** (not linked device) for the app to work properly.

### **Step 1: Start Docker**
```bash
cd signal-api
docker-compose up -d
```

### **Step 2: Register Your Phone Number**
```bash
cd signal-api
./register.sh
```
- Enter your phone number (e.g., `+40XXXXXXXXX`)
- You'll receive an SMS with a verification code

### **Step 3: Verify Your Number**
```bash
./verify.sh
```
- Enter the verification code from the SMS

### **Step 4: Sync Your Groups**
```bash
./sync-groups.sh
```
- This will fetch all your Signal groups

**✅ Now you're ready!** Your number is registered as primary and Docker is running.

**Note:** 
- You only need to do this registration **once**
- Docker must be running whenever you use the app
- Use primary registration, NOT device linking for full functionality

---

## 🆕 **NEW: Broadcast Feature**

### **What's New:**

The app now supports **three ways to send messages**:

#### **1. Send to Groups (Original)**
- Select from your Signal groups
- All group members see the message

- Enter individual phone numbers
- No group needed
- Direct one-on-one messaging

#### **3. Broadcast to Multiple People (NEW!)** 📤
- Enter multiple phone numbers (comma or newline-separated)
- Same message to all recipients
- Perfect for notifications and alerts

### **How to Use in Web Interface:**

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. You'll see **two tabs**:
   - **👥 Send to Group** (original)
